# PyBer_Analysis
Analyze PyBer ride share data using Python 3.9.6 and Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0

## Overview of Project

### Background
While working on the analysis of PyBer data by city type, the PyBer CEO, V.Isualize, requests a new analysis including a summary data frame and chart showing total fares for January - April 2019 for each city type. 

### Purpose
As an introduction to Matplotlib, the purpose of this project was to utilize plots in Pandas DataFrames with Python to complete the analysis and visualize the data. 
V.Isualize requested a new analysis, so the script will produce a summary and line plot for the purpose of making recommendations to address disparities among the city types. 


## Results
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. 

### Deliverable 1: _A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type_
Ride-sharing data includes the total rides, total drivers, total fares, and average fare per ride and driver.
